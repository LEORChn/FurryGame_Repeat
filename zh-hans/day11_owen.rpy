"The dance ended and night took over before I knew it."
"After the events of today I was completely exhausted,{w=.3} but sleep just wouldn't come."
"My clock ticked painfully at 2AM even as I tossed and turned in my bed."

"With a sigh,{w=.3} I gave up on sleep altogether and grabbed my phone."
"I wonder if Owen is still up?"

"With a tap,{w=.3} I sent him a quick text."

m "{i}Hey Owen, how are you doing? {/i}"
"There was a long pause.{w=.3} I thought Owen wasn't going to respond until-"
o "{i}Can't read right now,{w=.3} some asshole woke me up at an ungodly hour so now I am dead.{/i}"

"I couldn't help but chuckle."
"He's relaxed enough to joke around. {w=.3}Maybe he's not as mad at me now."
m "{i}Sleep is for the weak you fool.{/i}"
o "{i}And I am a weak, weak man.{/i}"
o "{i}Anyway, what do you want?{/i}"
m "{i}I.....{w=.3} I just wanted to appologize for yesterday.{/i}"

m "{i}You were right,{w=.3} I acted without really thinking about it.{/i}"

"My texting was interrupted as my phone suddenly rang with an incoming call."
"I answered and laughed as Owen's tired voice echoed through the speakers."
o "Yo [charname],{w=.3} don't you know the golden rule?"
o "You should never send an appology over text."

m "Well I couldn't just march into your room and wake you up at 2AM."
m "Phillip would probably kill me."
o "Actually Phillip isn't here right now.{w=.3} He's been kinda MIA for the entire evening actually."

o ".......The room's kinda empty without him."
o "Actually, didn't you say you wanted to appologize?"
o "Come over!{w=.3} You can make things up to me by spending the night here!"

m "You're inviting me into your room while your roommate is gone?"
m "Sounds kinda naughty if you really think about it."
o "Waaaaah?{w=.3} Me?{w=.3} Being naughty?"
o "I'd never!"
o "Surely you know that I'm renown across the land for my purity and virginity~!"
m "Your virginity probably died before it got to see the light of day."
m "Are you at least wearing something?"

o ".......well 'course not.{w=.3} I sleep nude."
m "I knew it.{p=.3}This was a trap,{w=.3} a very lewd trap."
o "Heh, my offer still stands.{w=.3} Are you coming over or not?"
o "I hate empty rooms..."

"Owen's cheerful tone faltered for a moment."
"I sighed and fumbled out of bed with great effort."
m "I'll be right over."

"I gingerly opened the door and laughed."
"Owen was rolled up in a sad fabric burrito on the floor with only the tips of his ears pointing out."
"And then my cheeks instantly grew heated.{w=.3} My god, he's naked under there."

"Crouching down,{w=.3} I gave Owen a pat on where his face should be."
m "You doing alright there Owen?"

"He grumbled and popped his head out from under the fabric."
o "I'm.........{w=.3}confused."
o "I just talked to my father for the first time in {i}{b}years.{/b}{/i}"
o "Everything feels like a weird fever dream if I'm being honest."


m "What did you guys talk about?"
o "Stuff."
o "He said he was sorry for being so neglectful and that he regretted what he's done in the last few years."
o "The whole thing was really awkward to be honest."
o "But he really sounded like he wanted to make things up!"
o "Maybe we can finally be a family again!"

"Owen sat up from his fabric roll and sighed tiredly."
o "And maybe I won't have to spend all my nights alone."

m "How do you usually deal with being alone all the time?"
"Owen snorted."
o "Me?"
o "These days, {w=.3}I just talk and vent all my problems to Phillip."
o "I'm pretty sure he doesn't actually pay attention,{w=.3} but it's nice to have someone pretending to listen."

o "And before Phillip got here,{w=.3} I hooked up with people on Grindr and vented my frustrations in the steamier way~"

o ".....................{p=.3}....It's nice to just have someone close by,{w=.3} you know?"
"I lean onto Owen and sank against his chest.{w=.3} He was very warm."
m "Well I'm here too.{w=.3} Let me know if there's anything I can do to help."
m "And....{w=.3}I'm sorry for what I did today."
m "It probably wasn't the best way of doing things."

"Owen smiled softly."

"I yelped as he suddenly picked me up, bridal style,{w=.3} and tossed me onto the nearest bed."
"His warm arms wrapped around me as we sank into the mattress."
o "You're forgiven.{w=.3} For the most part."
o "I know you were only trying to help.{w=.3}.....Just don't do it again."
m "Heh, sounds good."
m "...........{w=.3}so why are we snuggling naked here again?"
"Owen snorted."
o "Are you complaining?"
o "I'm a bit touch-starved these last few weeks and Phillip hates snuggles apparently."
o "Just let me indulge myself,{w=.3} just this once."

"I leaned against Owen,{w=.3} my back pressing snuggly into his firm heated chest."
"I sighed softly."
m "Of course."
