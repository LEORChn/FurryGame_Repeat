"Suddenly,{w=.3} I heard that familiar voice again."
"It was soft, gentle, patient…..{w=.3} like it had all the time in the world."

"???" "Hello again,{w=.3} [charname]."
m "W-where am I?"
m "A-and what is this place?"

"???" "This is a world of second chances."
"???" "I was a person filled with many regrets,{w=.3} and when the world collapsed around me-"
"???" "Well,{w=.3} I created this place.{p=1}With Halley's help,{w=.3} of course."

"???" "If you had the chance to go back and do everything over again,{w=.3} to save everyone...{p=.3}Would you?"

"I stared into the empty space and gulped."
"The chance to make everything better....{w=.3} to make things right again..."
m "Of course.{w=.3} I'd do anything to make that happy."
m "Everyone.....{w=.3} they deserved better than this."
"???" "And now,{w=.3} I give all my second chances to you."
"???" "So long as you don't repeat the same mistakes...{w=.3} You have it in you to set things right,{w=.3} I know it."

"The ground below me suddenly disappeared."
"I could feel myself falling into the abyss."
"I flailed my arms and screamed into this empty clockwork realm."
m "Wait!{w=.3} Who are you?!"
"???" "...You'll remember eventually."
"???" "I'll see you again soon,{w=.3} [charname]."
