"This morning rolled almost mechanically, {w=.3}and before I knew it I was already in class."
"Writing Workshop was as dull as I remembered it,{w=.3} even with Mr. Rokov substituting for Dolores."
"Students all around me were bustling with anticipation (or lack thereof) for Visitor's Day tomorrow."

"I didn't pay much attention to it all."
"My morning was spent quietly looking over my shoulder every now and then."
"It could be just paranoia, {w=.3}but there was a nervous weight on my shoulders that accompanied the anxious knot gnawing at my stomach."
"Focusing on class was impossible when I was expecting another disaster to barrel through the door at any moment."

"But nothing came, {w=.3}which felt almost worse."

"To top it all off,{w=.3} none of my usual company was with me today."
"Phillip was off helping some teachers prepare for Visitor's Day,{w=.3} and Sissel said he was busy with some sort of contest."
"And Owen.......{w=.3}well he said nothing but he looked like he didn't want to stick around today."

"It just hit me how empty everything feels without them......."

"The bell suddenly shrieked,{w=.3} signaling the end of class.{p=.3}Ugh finally."
"With a sigh,{w=.3} I haul myself up from my seat to follow the sea of scurrying students."
"Classes were finished and there was nobody to hang out with.{w=.3} There's not much point to anything today,{w=.3} is there?"
"Time to go back to my room and take a nap."

"Ugh whatever,{w=.3} I'll just sleep it off and shut down for today."
"It's hard to even get out of bed nowadays..."

"I reached for the doorknob,{w=.3} but something stops me."
