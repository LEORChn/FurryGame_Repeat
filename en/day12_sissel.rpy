"There was shouting,{w=.3} half-awake grumbles,{w=.3} and an agitated Hershel dragging us out of the bathroom because he urgently needed to pee." 
"At some point,{w=.3} the fear of being late and disappointing Mrs. Corlisse struck me like the wrath of God."
"I immediately booked it back to Gerania Academy in a mad dash with Sissel waving drowsily as I disappeared down the street."
